        Movement classes according to the Ilan Lev Method
    </h2>

    <p>
        The classes are made to improve the inner body dialogue and develop our functioning abilities out of the motion of inner listening and self pulsating.
        In these group classes, the participants are laying on the floor, sitting or moving. The class process is refreshing, intriguing and increasing the body's vitality. Through various images, we learn to break through functional patterns that we have collected over the years, with the understanding that this is how the deepest learning takes place.

        The activity is intended for all those who want to improve their functioning abilities.
