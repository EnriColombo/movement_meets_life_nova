        During a session, the practitioner brings to the body of the receiver a wide variety of movements, vibrations, playful provocations. These create the environment in which the body's natural ability to heal itself can arise, we discover an optimal range of motion, efficiency of effort, and a new understanding of ourselves.
        This allows new physical pathways and coordinations to emerge or become clearer, old habits to be thrown out, and physical and emotional trauma to be released.
        In this way, the movement returns to parts of the body where communication was cut-off or stopped due to injury, pain, or emotional issues. And the dialogue within the whole system is restored.
