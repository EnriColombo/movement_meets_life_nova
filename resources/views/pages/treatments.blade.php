                'question' => "Why ILM is different from a normal massage?",
                'answer' =>  "A normal massage is focused on <b>muscles and soft tissues</b>, in the Ilan Lev method instead the focus is the <b>skeleton</b>. <br> The <b>movement and vibrations</b> spread from the structure of the practitioner to the one of the receiver. <br>
Everything is attached to the skeleton: muscles, fascia, nervous system, blood system, immune system.<br>
We never force, it's a <b>dialogue with mutual listening</b>.<br>
If the tensions were coming out of a bad habit, after the massage they will come back. <br>
An Ilan Lev bodywork instead, allows the receiver to: restore the ability to get feedback from that area, improve the relation between that area and the rest of the body, experience new movement possibilities.",

                'answer' =>  "The more we are stressed somewhere and the less we are able to get feedback for that part of our body. <br> This because the tensions cut off the sensations. <br> So when we have tensions we are not able to identify what is going on and work to release that.",

                            In the body, this tension presents itself as difficulties in functioning.<br>
                            Can be little pain, or discomfort, or can be bigger like a chronic difficulties.<br>
                            And by the time we notice that we are injured and we don't know how it happened.<br>
                            Just when it starts to destabilize us we notice it.<br>

Although the first treatment it's something new for the body and it's too early to draw conclusions, and also each client and case is different. I usually suggest planning for 5 sessions within a month. A series of treatments can bring good improvements and a good perspective about the results.",
